/* Since we have a list of skills that we want in a group we can accomplish this with flex box and setting the flex-wrap to wrap and get our even spacing without padding using

we also want to set the cursor to pointer to ensure that it shows the user that you can click here for an action */


/* Since we don't need the same styling on ever tabs we can use the psuedo class last-child to target the last tab in our lo group and style it so that it resembles more of an end to the list
and not possibly confuse the user and think oh maybe I need to click and drag or tap and drag left or right for more options*/

/* Add bottom margin to the individual li's inside the content of the tab */


/* Again we don't always need the same styling for every element in our list or even in a div so we can use :lest-child again to represent more of an ending to our list */


/* Set the styling for our list groups subtitles*/


/* Set padding between the subtitle and the list items themselves and push them to the right some to make it appear as a second list items*/


/* Style the list title */


/* Set font size of list items */


/* Set the list items span to inline block so that its on the same level and the list item category*/


/* Set the width of the contact list items so that they don't go outside their container causing a side scroll*/


/* Set font weight for the contact answers */
